Traffic jams are one of the crucial issues in India due to which ambulance services get affected on a large amount, due to delay in ambulance service, patients may lose their lives and the number of these scenarios are increasing day by day. Also there is manual allocation of ambulances.
We tend to solve this problem using our smart system which uses integration of google maps api with our solution to allocate ambulances which can reach to the patient quickest.

We use Google maps in day to day life to reach to some destination in the quickest and shortest way possible.We integrated this technology to find the nearest ambulance service possible to the patient, so that it can reach as soon as possible.
Mostly the relatives of the patient are notified later by the hospital. We tend to solve this problem by notifying them as soon as the patient makes a distress call. 
We have also cut the call waiting time by implementing it using a button, hence reducing the time in half.
